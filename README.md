# SnakeGame
Python project.....

Snake is a video game built in python for this project repository.

***RULES OF THE GAME :-***

The player controls a long, thin creature,
resembling a snake, which roams around on
a bordered plane, picking up food (a blue dot like 
object), trying to avoid hitting its own tail
or the edges of the playing area. Each time
the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows
longer, making the game increasingly
difficult. The user controls the direction of
the snake's head (up, down, left, or right),
and the snake's body follows.
